"""//! Custom Diff and Merge Driver Implementation
//!
//! This module provides the logic for acting as a custom diff and merge driver
//! for Git, enabling AST/CST-based comparisons and merges.
//!
//! ## Custom Diff Driver (`git-ast diff-driver`)
//!
//! Invoked by Git when `diff=ast` is set in `.gitattributes` and a corresponding
//! `[diff "ast"] command = git-ast diff-driver` is configured.
//!
//! **Purpose:** Generate a textual diff representation based on structural (AST/CST)
//! comparison, ignoring pure formatting changes.
//!
//! **Git Invocation:** Git typically calls the command with 7 arguments:
//! `path old-file old-hex old-mode new-file new-hex new-mode`
//! See `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF` in `git(1)` man page.
//!
//! **Implementation Steps:**
//! 1.  Receive arguments from Git.
//! 2.  Obtain the content of the old and new versions (e.g., by reading the
//!     provided file paths, or potentially by accessing blobs via hex IDs if needed).
//!     *Important:* If using clean/smudge filters, the content received might be
//!     source text already smudged by Git, or it might be the raw AST blobs if
//!     accessed directly. The driver needs to handle this (likely by running the
//!     smudge logic internally or by parsing directly if ASTs are accessible).
//! 3.  Parse both versions into AST/CSTs.
//! 4.  Perform a tree diff operation (e.g., using `gumtree-rs` or a similar algorithm)
//!     to identify structural changes (adds, deletes, moves, updates).
//! 5.  Format the structural changes into a human-readable textual diff format.
//!     This might resemble unified diff or be a custom format highlighting AST changes.
//! 6.  Write the formatted diff to stdout.
//!
//! **Impact on `git log`:** When this driver is configured, `git log -p` will
//! automatically use it to generate patch text for commits involving files with `diff=ast`.
//!
//! ## Custom Merge Driver (`git-ast merge-driver`)
//!
//! Invoked by Git during a merge (or cherry-pick, revert) when `merge=ast` is set
//! in `.gitattributes` and `[merge "ast"] driver = git-ast merge-driver ...` is configured.
//!
//! **Purpose:** Perform a 3-way merge based on AST/CST structure, aiming to handle
//! refactorings and concurrent structural changes more intelligently than text-based merges.
//!
//! **Git Invocation:** Git calls the driver command with placeholders replaced:
//! `git-ast merge-driver %O %A %B %L %P`
//!   - `%O`: Path to a temporary file with the base version content.
//!   - `%A`: Path to a temporary file with the current branch version (read/write).
//!   - `%B`: Path to a temporary file with the other branch version.
//!   - `%L`: Conflict marker size (integer).
//!   - `%P`: Pathname of the file in the repository.
//!
//! **Implementation Steps:**
//! 1.  Receive arguments (resolved file paths) from Git.
//! 2.  Read the content of the base (`%O`), current (`%A`), and other (`%B`) versions.
//!     *Important:* Similar to the diff driver, this content might be source text or
//!     raw AST blobs depending on how Git invokes the driver relative to filters.
//!     The driver likely needs to smudge/parse these inputs.
//! 3.  Parse all three versions into AST/CSTs.
//! 4.  Perform a 3-way tree merge algorithm.
//! 5.  **Conflict Handling:**
//!     - If the merge is clean, generate the resulting source code from the merged AST/CST.
//!     - If conflicts occur that the AST merge cannot resolve, either:
//!         a) Generate source code containing standard `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`
//!            conflict markers (using `%L` for marker size) around the conflicting sections.
//!         b) Abort the merge for this file.
//! 6.  Write the resulting merged source code (or source with conflict markers) back
//!     to the file specified by `%A` (overwriting it).
//! 7.  **Exit Code:**
//!     - Exit `0` if the merge was successful (no conflicts or conflicts marked).
//!     - Exit with a non-zero status (e.g., `1`) if the merge failed completely or requires manual resolution beyond markers.
//!
//! **Note:** Implementing a robust 3-way AST merge algorithm with good conflict handling is complex.
