# This file represents the actual serialized data stored in a Git blob.
# It could be a binary format like CBOR, MessagePack, or compressed JSON/S-expressions.
# For illustration, imagine this is a compact S-expression representation:

(source_file
  (function_item name: add ...)
  (function_item name: main ...)
)

# Actual content would be determined by the chosen serialization library.
# Using a non-text format might be preferable for size/performance.
