# Example: Simple Rust Addition

This directory contains illustrative files demonstrating the `git-ast` workflow for a simple Rust code snippet.

## Files

- `01_original_source.rs`: The starting source code as a developer might write it (potentially with non-canonical formatting).
- `02_treesitter_cst.json`: A conceptual representation of the Concrete Syntax Tree (CST) produced by Tree-sitter. This includes comments and precise structure.
- `03_canonical_ast.json`: A conceptual representation of the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) intended for storage. It might be simplified or normalized compared to the full CST.
- `04_stored_blob.git-ast`: Represents the actual serialized format (e.g., CBOR, S-expression) that the `clean` filter outputs and Git stores as a blob.
- `05_generated_source.rs`: The source code generated by the `smudge` filter, using a deterministic formatter (`rustfmt` in this case) to enforce canonical style.

## Diffs (`diffs/` directory)

This subdirectory shows conceptual diff outputs:

- `text_diff_formatting.diff`: How a standard `git diff` might look if only formatting changed (noisy).
- `ast_diff_formatting.diff`: How an AST-aware diff should look for formatting changes (ideally, no changes).
- `text_diff_logic_change.diff`: Standard `git diff` for a simple logic change.
- `ast_diff_logic_change.diff`: How an AST-aware diff might represent the same logic change, focusing on the structural difference.
