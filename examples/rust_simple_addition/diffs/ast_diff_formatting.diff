# Conceptual AST Diff (Formatting Change Only)

# When comparing the ASTs derived from the poorly formatted source
# and the canonically formatted source, the AST-aware diff
# (using a tool like difftastic or a custom git-ast driver)
# should ideally report *no changes*, as the underlying structure is identical.

(No structural changes detected)
