# Conceptual AST Diff (Logic Change)

# An AST-aware diff would pinpoint the change within the structure,
# potentially highlighting the operator change directly.

# Output format might vary depending on the diff tool.
# Example using difftastic-like highlighting:

  fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
      // Simple addition
-     a + b
+     a - b
  }
