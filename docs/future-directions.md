# Future Directions & Exploratory Ideas

This document outlines potential long-term evolution paths and advanced concepts for Git AST that are currently beyond the scope of the core roadmap.

## MLIR Integration

An intriguing possibility for future development is the integration of the [MLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation)](https://mlir.llvm.org/) framework. MLIR is a powerful compiler infrastructure designed for representing code at multiple levels of abstraction, defining custom operations (dialects), and performing complex transformations.

**How MLIR Could Apply to `git-ast`:**

Instead of directly mapping Tree-sitter ASTs/CSTs to Git objects, MLIR could serve as the core intermediate representation:

*   **Structured Representation:** Source code could be lowered into custom MLIR dialects representing language semantics (e.g., `rust.gitast`) and potentially even Git concepts.
*   **Semantic Operations:** MLIR's infrastructure is built for analysis and transformation. Semantic diffing, merging, and refactoring operations could potentially be implemented as MLIR passes operating directly on the IR.
*   **Node Identity:** MLIR's structured nature might offer more robust ways to track semantic node identity across commits.
*   **Code Generation:** MLIR includes pretty-printing capabilities that could drive the code generation for the working directory view (via the smudge filter).

Essentially, `git-ast` could become a system that "compiles" source code changes into MLIR transformations, which are then serialized and stored in Git (perhaps using MLIR's [bytecode format](https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/BytecodeFormat/)).

**Considerations:**

*   **Novelty:** Applying MLIR in this manner is outside its typical compiler optimization and hardware targeting use cases.
*   **Complexity:** Integrating MLIR would add significant complexity and a major dependency (LLVM). It requires specialized expertise.
*   **Maturity:** This approach is highly experimental and would require substantial research and development.

**Status:** This is currently an exploratory idea and **not** part of the core roadmap. It represents a potential long-term evolution or alternative architecture worth investigating only once the foundational pieces of `git-ast` (based on Tree-sitter and filters) are mature and well-established.

## Other Potential Ideas

*   **Advanced Node Identity Tracking:** Developing robust mechanisms (beyond simple heuristics) for tracking code elements through complex refactorings.
*   **Semantic Blame:** Extending `git blame` to understand code movement and structural changes.
*   **IDE / Language Server Integration:** Providing real-time feedback or AST manipulation capabilities within editors.
*   **Customizable Formatting Profiles:** Allowing teams or users more control over the output formatting (potentially challenging the "single canonical format" principle, adding complexity).
*   **CRDT-based Collaboration:** Exploring Conflict-free Replicated Data Types for managing AST changes, potentially enabling real-time collaboration features.
