## Understanding Git AST

Git AST builds on several key technologies and concepts:

1. **Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs)** - Tree representations of code structure
2. **Git Clean/Smudge Filters** - Git's mechanism for transforming content
3. **Tree-sitter** - The parsing technology used to generate syntax trees
4. **Code Formatters** - Tools for generating consistently formatted code

For a comprehensive understanding of these concepts, start with the [Key Concepts](./key-concepts.md) document.
